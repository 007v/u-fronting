# Analyses of /u/-fronting

This github repo contains data, simulations and analyses for my talk on /u/-fronting. Here is an outline of the contents:

- u-fronting-master-analysis.rmd: all the main analyses in a single file
- u-fronting-master-analysis.html: an html version that can be viewed in a browser
- ~/shiny-app: an interactive shiny application for simulating /u/-fronting; just load app.r in RStudio and click on play
- ~/data/raw_data: raw cross-linguistic data sets
- ~/data/scripts: scripts for data wrangling
- ~/data/final_data: final clean cross-linguistic data sets and simulation results
- ~/data/topics: GAM regression model fitted to Derby Goose data (can be loaded with readRDS)
