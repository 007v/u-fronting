## Where does /y/ come from?

/y/ can arise in a number of ways: through vowel harmony, contextual effects, fronting of /u/, rounding of /i/, etc. Here we classify the XX languages in WALS with /y/ according to the likely source of /u/, relying mainly on info about language families & linguistic history.
